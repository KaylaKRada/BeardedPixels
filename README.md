📸 Bearded Pixels Admin Panel – Portfolio Project
Course: Java 2

✨ Overview  
The Bearded Pixels Admin Panel is a full-stack web application built with Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for my husband's photography business. This project allows the site admin (him!) to upload, edit, and organize photos and albums dynamically from a custom dashboard. It connects directly to the main site so updates reflect immediately for clients. This was one of my first full CRUD-based applications using Spring Boot, and it helped solidify my backend development skills.

🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

#
🔹 Challenge / Context  
I wanted to create a tool that could help me manage my photography content without needing to update the website manually every time I uploaded new photos. I created the client-facing website and needed something powerful on the backend. I took on the challenge of building a full admin dashboard that could work in sync with my database and site frontend.

#
🔧 Action  
I used Spring Boot and IntelliJ to build out a clean structure for my app (controllers, models, repositories, services), integrated a PostgreSQL database, and created HTML templates with Thymeleaf. The admin panel includes pages for adding and editing albums and photos. I also wrote custom CSS for the admin dashboard and created templates that display uploaded content visually for easy management.
#

#
✅ Result  
The panel allows admin to log in, create new albums, upload photos to each album, and edit/delete content as needed. It updates my website instantly since the client-facing site pulls from the same database. It gave me hands-on experience with Spring MVC, form handling, and CRUD operations with database persistence.

#
💭 Reflection  
This project gave me real-world experience in managing both backend logic and frontend interaction for a live website. It taught me how to connect a working admin tool to a public-facing app and strengthened my understanding of Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. I’m proud of how much I learned and how usable the result is for my business. I’d love to expand it with image labeling, booking management, and even drag-and-drop uploading in the future.
